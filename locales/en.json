We provide sales of spare parts for various brands and brands. The problems we faced both when we were sellers and when we were buyers forced us to take another step forward. In 2018, together with our team, we started to develop a digital project on a more convenient way for buyers and sellers, and Beta versions of the web platform and mobile application called \"Otobaza\" are already operational.",
  "project_vision": "The Purpose of the project",
  "project_vision_text": "<p>Buyers have always been concerned about how accurate the price is and why not in the store he went to or problems where there may be.</p><p>What worries sellers is why buyers don't apply when I have a spare part and the price is right.</p> <p>Since we are experiencing both of these situations, we are offering this site to you this year, thinking that it will benefit both sellers and buyers. Our goal is to offer buyers the spare parts they are looking for at a more affordable price and at a wider list. The aim is to increase the customer base of sellers. </p>",
